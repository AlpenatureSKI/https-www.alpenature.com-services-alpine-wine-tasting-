Wines from the Alps give you a one-of-a-kind taste that shows off the many different terroirs you find in mountain areas like the Alps.
These wines use local grape types such as Petit Rouge, Jacqu√®re, and Fendant, which bring out bright acidity and clear mineral notes. 
To make the most of this, you can set up a tasting with picks from places like Aosta Valley, Savoie, and Valais, and serve them with cheeses and cured meats from those areas. 
As you drink, you get to learn about the long history and rich culture of the Alps making it a fun trip for your taste buds and your mind.
